"Welcome to the Cheat Engine Tutorial (v3.4)\n"
"\n"
"This tutorial will teach you the basics of cheating in video games. It will also show you foundational aspects of using Cheat Engine (or CE for short). Follow the steps below to get started.\n"
"\n"
"1: Open Cheat Engine if it currently isn't running.\n"
"2: Click on the \"Open Process\" icon (it's the top-left icon with the computer on it, below \"File\".).\n"
"3: With the Process List window now open, look for this tutorial's process in the list. It will look something like \"00001F98-Tutorial-x86_64.exe\" or \"0000047C-Tutorial-i386.exe\". (The first 8 numbers/letters will probably be different.)\n"
"4: Once you've found the process, click on it to select it, then click the \"Open\" button. (Don't worry about all the other buttons right now. You can learn about them later if you're interested.)\n"
"\n"
"Congratulations! If you did everything correctly, the process window should be gone with Cheat Engine now attached to the tutorial (you will see the process name towards the top-center of CE).\n"
"\n"
"Click the \"Next\" button below to continue, or fill in the password and click the \"OK\" button to proceed to that step.)\n"

"If you're having problems, simply head over to forum.cheatengine.org, then click on \"Tutorials\" to view beginner-friendly guides!\n"

" ( •̀ ω •́ )✧ 欢迎来到 Cheat Engine 新手教程 (v3.4)\n"
"------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"
"本教程会教你「如何在游戏中作弊」的基本知识。\n"
"既然是个新手菜鸟，先从基本操作开始动手吧。\n"
"\n"
"#1 启动 Cheat Engine 主程序\n"
"如果你还没运行，先将它启动。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"#2 点击「打开进程」图标\n"
" ▪ 它是工具栏第一个图标，像一个电脑+放大镜。\n"
" ▪ 它位于菜单栏-文件的下方。\n"
" ▪ 如果你是首次启动，可能还能看到它还有个不断闪烁的边框。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"#3 找到「Tutorial」进程\n"
" ▪ 在进程列表窗口中，将列表拉到底部，找到本教程的进程。\n"
" ▪ 它标题类似 “00001234-Tutorial-x86_64.exe” (前面的八个数字可能会不一样)\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"如果你已经看到了这个进程，选中它，然后点击「打开」按钮。\n（先别管其它按钮，如果你感兴趣，你会在后面接触到它们的）\n"
"\n---\n\n"
"先提前恭喜你！\n如果你全都做对了，进程列表窗口会自动关闭，并且在 Cheat Engine 页面中间顶部的位置看到该进程的名字。\n"
"\n\n"
"现在，你可以点击 “下一步” 按钮来继续学习教程了。如果你知道某个跳关密码，也可以输入它跳转到相应的教学关卡\n"
"\n\n"
"如果你遇到了任何问题，可以到交流论坛 forum.cheatengine.org 教程板块反馈，你还能在论坛中找到更多针对初学者的内容。\n"

"Now that you have opened the tutorial with Cheat Engine let's get on with the next step.\n"
"\n"
"You can see at the bottom of this window is the text Health: xxx\n"
"Each time you click 'Hit me'  your health gets decreased.\n"
"\n"
"To get to the next step you have to find this value and change it to 1000\n"
"\n"
"To find the value there are different ways, but I'll tell you about the easiest, 'Exact Value':\n"
"First make sure value type is set to at least 2-bytes or 4-bytes. 1-byte will also work, but you'll run into an easy to fix problem when you've found the address and want to change it. The 8-byte may perhaps works if the bytes after the address are 0, but I wouldn't take the bet.\n"
"Single, double, and the other scans just don't work, because they store the value in a different way.\n"
"\n"
"When the value type is set correctly, make sure the scantype is set to 'Exact Value'\n"
"Then fill in the number your health is in the value box. And click 'First Scan'\n"
"After a while (if you have a extremely slow pc) the scan is done and the results are shown in the list on the left\n"
"\n"
"If you find more than 1 address and you don't know for sure which address it is, click 'Hit me', fill in the new health value into the value box, and click 'Next Scan'\n"
"repeat this until you're sure you've found it. (that includes that there's only 1 address in the list.....)\n"
"\n"
"Now double click the address in the list on the left. This makes the address pop-up in the list at the bottom, showing you the current value.\n"
"Double click the value, (or select it and press enter), and change the value to 1000.\n"
"\n"
"If everything went ok the next button should become enabled, and you're ready for the next step.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Note:\n"
"If you did anything wrong while scanning, click \"New Scan\" and repeat the scanning again.\n"
"Also, try playing around with the value and click 'hit me'\n"

"【提示】\n\n"
"尽管有各种不同的方法都能找到生命值的内存地址\n"

"\n"
" ▪ 首先，将 [扫描类型] 设置为「精确数值」\n"
" ▪ 接着，把 [数值类型] 设置为「4 字节」\n"
" ▪ 然后，在上方的输入框填入当前 生命值 的数值，并点击 ‹首次扫描› \n"
"\n"
"等待扫描完毕，左边的列表会显示扫描结果。你可能会找到非常多的地址，而且你无法确认哪个才是真的。\n"
"\n"
"现在，可以点击 ‹打我› 按钮，让生命值发生变化，然后再次输入新的数值并点击「再次扫描」按钮。这样反复操作几次，直到你确定找到了真正的地址。（或者列表中只剩下一个地址）\n"
"\n"
"双击这个地址，它会出现在窗口下面的列表里，你还能看到它当前的数值，然后双击这个数值，（或者选中并按下回车键），把数值修改成 1000 \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"如果操作正确，“下一步” 按钮就会变成激活的状态。\n"
"恭喜你，过关了！准备好进入下一关吧！\n"

"Ok, seeing that you've figured out how to find a value using exact value let's move on to the next step.\n"
"\n"
"First things first though. Since you are doing a new scan, you have to click on New Scan first, to start a new scan. (You may think this is straighforward, but you'd be surprised how many people get stuck on that step) I won't be explaining this step again, so keep this in mind\n"
"Now that you've started a new scan, let's continue\n"
"\n"
"In the previous test we knew the initial value so we could do a exact value, but now we have a status bar where we don't know the starting value.\n"
"We only know that the value is between 0 and 500. And each time you click 'hit me' you lose some health. The amount you lose each time is shown above the status bar.\n"
"\n"
"Again there are several different ways to find the value. (like doing a decreased value by... scan), but I'll only explain the easiest. \"Unknown initial value\", and decreased value.\n"
"Because you don't know the value it is right now, a exact value wont do any good, so choose as scantype 'Unknown initial value', again, the value type is 4-bytes. (most windows apps use 4-bytes)click first scan and wait till it's done.\n"
"\n"
"When it is done click 'hit me'. You'll lose some of your health. (the amount you lost shows for a few seconds and then disappears, but you don't need that)\n"
"Now go to Cheat Engine, and choose 'Decreased Value' and click 'Next Scan'\n"
"When that scan is done, click hit me again, and repeat the above till you only find a few. \n"
"\n"
"We know the value is between 0 and 500, so pick the one that is most likely the address we need, and add it to the list.\n"
"Now change the health to 5000, to proceed to the next step.\n"

"------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"
"看来你已经学会怎么利用精确数值查找地址了，这次提高一下难度。上一关，我们是已经知道初始值，所以可以用精确值进行扫描。\n"
