"Welcome to the Cheat Engine Tutorial (v3.4)\n"
"\n"
"This tutorial will teach you the basics of cheating in video games. It will also show you foundational aspects of using Cheat Engine (or CE for short). Follow the steps below to get started.\n"
"\n"
"1: Open Cheat Engine if it currently isn't running.\n"
"2: Click on the \"Open Process\" icon (it's the top-left icon with the computer on it, below \"File\".).\n"
"3: With the Process List window now open, look for this tutorial's process in the list. It will look something like \"00001F98-Tutorial-x86_64.exe\" or \"0000047C-Tutorial-i386.exe\". (The first 8 numbers/letters will probably be different.)\n"
"4: Once you've found the process, click on it to select it, then click the \"Open\" button. (Don't worry about all the other buttons right now. You can learn about them later if you're interested.)\n"
"\n"
"Congratulations! If you did everything correctly, the process window should be gone with Cheat Engine now attached to the tutorial (you will see the process name towards the top-center of CE).\n"
"\n"
"Click the \"Next\" button below to continue, or fill in the password and click the \"OK\" button to proceed to that step.)\n"
"\n"
"If you're having problems, simply head over to forum.cheatengine.org, then click on \"Tutorials\" to view beginner-friendly guides!\n"

"\n"
"You can see at the bottom of this window is the text Health: xxx\n"
"Each time you click 'Hit me'  your health gets decreased.\n"
"\n"
"To get to the next step you have to find this value and change it to 1000\n"
"\n"
"To find the value there are different ways, but I'll tell you about the easiest, 'Exact Value':\n"
"First make sure value type is set to at least 2-bytes or 4-bytes. 1-byte will also work, but you'll run into an easy to fix problem when you've found the address and want to change it. The 8-byte may perhaps works if the bytes after the address are 0, but I wouldn't take the bet.\n"
"Single, double, and the other scans just don't work, because they store the value in a different way.\n"

"When the value type is set correctly, make sure the scantype is set to 'Exact Value'\n"
"Then fill in the number your health is in the value box. And click 'First Scan'\n"
