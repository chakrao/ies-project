# Usage
### Linux
 - Start ceserver with administrator privileges.`sudo ./ceserver`

 - Select the Network tab of the process list. In the Host field, enter localhost (via Wine) or Guest OS ip (on a virtual machine).

### Android
 - Execute `su` and start ceserver with root privileges.
 - Run the adb command on the PC.`adb forward tcp:52736 tcp:52736`
 - Start Cheat Engine.
 - Select the Network tab of the process list. In the Host field, enter localhost (Android Emulator) or Android device ip address (real Android device).
 
### Execution options
 - `-a`
Perform module enumeration only for the specified process ID.
 - `-m` 
If `1` is specified, memory is read and written only with the ptrace privilege, not via the virtual file system.
 - `-p`
Listen on the specified port number instead of the default 52736.

 - `-s`
It is disassembled with the specified architecture regardless of the ceserver architecture. It is convenient to specify with Android emulator (x86 and ARM are mixed)etc.
