/*
** Implementation of tables (aka arrays, objects, or hash tables).
** Tables keep its elements in two parts: an array part and a hash part.
** Non-negative integer keys are all candidates to be kept in the array
** part. The actual size of the array is the largest 'n' such that at
** least half the slots between 0 and n are in use.
** Hash uses a mix of chained scatter table with Brent's variation.
** A main invariant of these tables is that, if an element is not
** in its main position (i.e. the 'original' position that its hash gives
** to it), then the colliding element is in its own main position.
** Hence even when the load factor reaches 100%, performance remains good.
