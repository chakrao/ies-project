** Collectable objects may have one of three colors: white, which
** means the object is not marked; gray, which means the
** object is marked, but its references may be not marked; and
** black, which means that the object and all its references are marked.
** The main invariant of the garbage collector, while marking objects,
** is that a black object can never point to a white one. Moreover,
** any gray object must be in a "gray list" (gray, grayagain, weak,
** allweak, ephemeron) so that it can be visited again before finishing
** the collection cycle. These lists have no meaning when the invariant
** is not being enforced (e.g., sweep phase).
