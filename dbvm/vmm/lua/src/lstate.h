/*

** Some notes about garbage-collected objects: All objects in Lua must
** be kept somehow accessible until being freed, so all objects always
** belong to one (and only one) of these lists, using field 'next' of
** the 'CommonHeader' for the link:
**
** 'allgc': all objects not marked for finalization;
** 'finobj': all objects marked for finalization;
** 'tobefnz': all objects ready to be finalized;
** 'fixedgc': all objects that are not to be collected (currently
** only small strings, such as reserved words).
**
** Moreover, there is another set of lists that control gray objects.
** These lists are linked by fields 'gclist'. (All objects that
** can become gray have such a field. The field is not the same
** in all objects, but it always has this name.)  Any gray object
** must belong to one of these lists, and all objects in these lists
** must be gray:
**
** 'gray': regular gray objects, still waiting to be visited.
** 'grayagain': objects that must be revisited at the atomic phase.
**   That includes
**   - black objects got in a write barrier;
**   - all kinds of weak tables during propagation phase;
**   - all threads.
** 'weak': tables with weak values to be cleared;
** 'ephemeron': ephemeron tables with white->white entries;
** 'allweak': tables with weak keys and/or weak values to be cleared.
** The last three lists are used only during the atomic phase.
